# SASS
Sukriti's Attendance Synchronization System

This python script automatically interperits an excel sheet generated by a google form and updates a primary excel sheet accordingly. This is designed to be part of the WPI SWE attendance management workflow although it should be easily modifiable for other purposes.

## Usage

This script, in its current state, is command line only. Invoking the command takes two arguments: `-i` for the input (google form) file and `-o` for the output (main) file. 

An example command invocation would be `python3 sass.py -i form.xlsx -o attendance.xlsx`

The script also contains interactive options accessed by entering numbers or text in the terminal. 

## Technical details

This is a quick-and-dirty program. There are no code comments and it's a bit spaghetti-ish. The main thing that might be confusing is that it uses a lot of +1 and -1 in indexing cells. This is due to conversions between python indexing that starts at 0 and Excel indexing which starts at 1. 

Adding a GUI or web frontend would not be very difficult and this may be done in a future release, along with being compiled into a proper EXE.
